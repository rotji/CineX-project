;; title: rewards-module
;; version: 1.0.0
;; Author: Victor Omenai 
;; Created: 2025

;; ========= Summary ==========
;; This rewards-module acts like a "Reward Manager" 
;;    => collecting minting fees, 
;;    => ensuring only the right people can give rewards, recording who earned what, 
;;    => and organizing mass (batch) reward distribution; the actual NFT minting is done separately by the NFT contract.


;; ========= Description ==========
;; Implementation of Rewards module trait
;; This Rewards Module in CineX handles the secure distribution of campaign rewards to contributors. It allows campaign owners to mint 
;; and assign NFT rewards based on contribution tiers, tracks each reward issued, and collects minting fees to support platform sustainability. 
;; The module ensures that rewards are properly authorized, recorded, and linked to the correct campaigns through direct interaction 
;; with the core CineX platform and a separate NFT rewards contract.

;; Strategic Purpose: Manages backer incentives and value delivery
;; This addresses the "Value Proposition component of the Business Model of CineX

;; Implements the Rewards Trait interface
(impl-trait .rewards-module-trait.rewards-trait)

;; Import traits that will be called 
(use-trait rewards-crowdfunding-trait .crowdfunding-module-traits.crowdfunding-trait)
(use-trait rewards-nft-trait .rewards-nft-trait.rewards-trait)



;; Contract principal as Core contract reference pointing to the CineX main contract
(define-data-var core-contract principal tx-sender)

;; Contract principal as Rewards-NFT contract reference pointing to the NFT contract that mints rewards
(define-data-var rewards-contract principal tx-sender)

;;  Contract principal variable as the crowdfunding module contract reference pointing to the crowdfunding contract
(define-data-var crowdfunding-contract principal tx-sender)

;; Constant holding contract-owner principal
(define-constant CONTRACT-OWNER tx-sender)

;; Constant fee required to mint a reward NFT (in microSTX, 1 STX = 1_000_000 microSTX)
